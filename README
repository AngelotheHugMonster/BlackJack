PROJECT TITLE: BlackJack
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a functioning game of BlackJack and learn from it
                    *With all the small details like:* 
                    -Splitting 
                    -Insurance 
                    -Aces counting as 1 and 11 //DONE//
                    +Being able to select modes from a Home Screen 
                    +An AI dealer //DONE//
                    +Two Player Mode
AUTHOR: Angelo S. Arriaga
USER INSTRUCTIONS: For BlueJ
    1)Right-click on "Main"
    2)Click on "void Main(String[] args)"
    3)Enter "{}" into the Pop-up and hit "Ok"
    
    
Version History:

2017-03-14 -- Tuesday
    *Project Created
    *Created the Card Class
        + Enumerations made to hold Suit and Rank values
        + Made an easy way to create Card Objects
        + Created Functions to easily call the card's Suit (String), Rank (String), and Value (int)
    *Demonstrated basic functionality of Card Class with the information functions
        
2017-03-18 -- Saturday
    *Created an Array named "truedeck" that will be used to create shuffled decks from
    *Demonstrated that the "truedeck" is a brand-new deck of cards (No duplicates, 13 of each suit, etc)
    *Created the method which shuffles "truedeck" into a "gamedeck" to be used AND IT FREAKING WORKED

2017-03-25 -- Saturday
    *Attempted to allow for user input using a Scanner to start the tests manually 
           -"userinput.NextLine()" did some stupid ass shit, Long story short, I failed
                It did stupid shit like like:
                    "Type 'test' and hit enter to test gamedeck: "
                    *types in 'test'*
                    "Test fail, received 'test' instead of 'test'"
                    *facepalm*
                Changed it to "userinput.Next()" didn't help
                
2017-03-31 -- Friday
    *Figured out what was wrong with the userinput thing (Needed to use ".equals()", I'm dumb)
    *On deck playback I added 1 to each number so it'd be from 1-52 instead of 0-51

2017-04-01 -- Saturday
    *Looked up tutorials on how to create custom windows, pasted some example code into the end of 
     the program, it worked.
    *Commented out the above and moved all GUI efforts into a different class ("TestGUI") to be more 
     organized and practical, the Main Class was getting too cluttered
    *Added comments in the Card class as well as the Rank and Suit enums to explain more about the 
     methods and what they do
     
2017-04-08 -- Saturday
    *Moved some code in the truedeck constructor so it doesn't run an unneccessary amount of times,
     it probably wasn't a big deal but I want this program to be as efficient and well-written as 
     possible, Ignore the Main method for now, that's a wasteland of test code, I'm going to scrap 
     it entirely when I get dealing and drawing and all that done.

2017-04-09 -- Sunday
    *Converted the gamedeck to a List instead of an array so it can have cards taken out of it
    *Moved a lot of functions that were related to deck manipulation to the "Card" class to be 
     more organized and just logical. (The program won't work now so I'm going to have to fix it)
    *Added the draw functions: "drawFirst()", "drawLast()", and "drawMid()".

2017-04-10 -- Monday
    *Ironed out the problems from yesterday
    *Made a lot of void functions actually return values so they would be more versatile
    *Made a List to serve as a hand, was able to draw cards and total up the value
        -Need to figure out a good way to make Aces count as a 1 AND 11
        
2017-04-11 -- Tuesday
    *Found a workaround for the "Ace being worth both a 1 and 11" problem
        -basically just set Aces to always be worth 11 in the "getValue()" method but in the 
        "totalHand()" function I made it subtract 10 from the total (to simulate an 11 turning 
        into a 1) until either all aces have been already made worth 1 or the total is finally 
        under 21
    *Finished more functions: "checkBust()", "checkNatural21()", "hit()", "readUserHand()", 
     "readOpponentHand()",  and "totalHand()"
    *Created the basic loop that controls the game, you are now able to draw to your heart's 
     content, stand when you want to, bust when you go over 21, and win/lose against a dealer 
     who actually has a *very* basic AI
     
2017-04-12 -- Wednesday  (Written 4/22)
    *Attempted to use SimpleGUIBuilder to build the GUI and it was going well, until I tried to use 
     the buttons, they're completely broken for some reason, you can't move them and they fuck over 
     the whole layout. I reasoned that it was because it was outdated so I searched for another tool 
     to use and found something similar on Eclipse. Thus I've started to try and moved this project 
     over in it's entirety. 
     I rather like BlueJ, it's been helpful but I want to use the tools Eclipse has. The 
     project is now actually playable (The only things missing being a GUI, menu, and two-player mode)
     so I think it's a success. I'm going to take a break and try coding something else, I'll come 
     back to this another day when I'm more experienced with UIs
     
 2017-04-24/25 -- Monday/Tuesday
 	*Moved over a lot of classes in packages so the project is neat and I can reuse portions easily
 		-I might be able to reuse that "playingCards" package in making Caravan, so this is actually 
 		 pretty useful
 	*Moved a lot of code into their own functions so I can demonstrate the program easier
